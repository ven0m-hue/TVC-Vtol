<b>Thrust Vector Controlled - Vertical Take-off and Landing UAV unit.</b>

Project aimed at autonomous stabilization of the flight and orientation, occurring during the vertical take-off
and landing. 

*STM based 32 bit micro-controller is used as a flight control unit(FPU).

*FPU interfaces all the sensors, actuates various control surfaces. (Avionics).

<b>Obeservers</b>

*Height estimation, for Vertical set-point 

*Orienation estimation for stabalization of the body (Vector Control)

<b>Controllers</b>

* PID for the Vectoring 
* MPC for Vertical and take off and landing.

**This is an on going project.
